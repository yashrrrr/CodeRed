# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Learner Engagement Platform is a comprehensive system designed to identify at-risk learners and provide personalized interventions through automated nudges. The platform combines risk assessment algorithms with AI-powered content generation to improve learner retention and engagement across educational programs. The system includes a FastAPI backend for data processing and API services, integrated with OpenAI for intelligent content generation, and a Streamlit dashboard for monitoring and manual interventions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Risk Assessment System

**User Story:** As an education administrator, I want to automatically identify at-risk learners based on their engagement metrics, so that I can intervene before they drop out of the program.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learner's data is processed THEN the system SHALL calculate a risk score between 0 and 1 using completion percentage, quiz scores, missed sessions, and login recency
2. WHEN the risk score is computed THEN the system SHALL assign a risk label (low, medium, high) based on predefined thresholds
3. WHEN learner data is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL apply defensive defaults and continue processing
4. WHEN multiple learners are processed THEN the system SHALL update all risk scores efficiently in batch operations

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Nudge Generation

**User Story:** As an education administrator, I want to generate personalized nudges for learners using AI, so that interventions are contextually relevant and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a nudge is requested for a learner THEN the system SHALL call OpenAI API with learner context to generate personalized content
2. WHEN OpenAI API is unavailable or fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to pre-defined nudge templates and mark the response with gptFallback flag
3. WHEN generating nudges THEN the system SHALL support multiple channels (in-app, WhatsApp, email) with appropriate formatting
4. WHEN API timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully within 8 seconds and provide fallback content
5. WHEN nudges are generated THEN the system SHALL track the prompt version and generation method for analytics

### Requirement 3: Learner Data Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage learner profiles and their engagement history, so that the platform has accurate data for risk assessment and nudge targeting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learner data is imported THEN the system SHALL validate required fields (name, email, program) and store in database
2. WHEN duplicate learners are detected THEN the system SHALL update existing records rather than create duplicates
3. WHEN learner events occur THEN the system SHALL track timestamps and metadata for engagement analysis
4. WHEN CSV data is uploaded THEN the system SHALL process it idempotently without data corruption
5. WHEN learner profiles are accessed THEN the system SHALL return current risk scores and recent nudge history

### Requirement 4: Dashboard and Monitoring Interface

**User Story:** As an education administrator, I want a visual dashboard to monitor learner risk levels and manually trigger interventions, so that I can oversee the engagement system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display learners sorted by risk level with key metrics visible
2. WHEN generating manual nudges THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback including fallback status
3. WHEN OpenAI fallbacks occur THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate simulated responses with visual indicators
4. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the dashboard SHALL display appropriate error messages and connection instructions

### Requirement 5: System Reliability and Fallback Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to remain functional even when external services fail, so that core operations continue during outages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenAI API key is missing THEN the system SHALL use local fallback content and continue operations
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
3. WHEN external API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL implement defensive timeouts and graceful degradation
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN the database tables SHALL be created automatically if they don't exist
5. WHEN seed data is loaded THEN the operation SHALL be idempotent and safe to run multiple times

### Requirement 6: API and Integration Layer

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-structured REST APIs for all platform operations, so that I can integrate with other systems and build additional interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and return appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN learner data is requested THEN the system SHALL support filtering by risk level and pagination
3. WHEN simulation runs are triggered THEN the system SHALL recompute all risk scores and optionally generate auto-nudges
4. WHEN quiz generation is requested THEN the system SHALL return structured quiz content with fallback handling
5. WHEN CORS requests are made THEN the system SHALL allow local development origins for frontend integration

### Requirement 7: Development and Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and development tools, so that I can maintain code quality and deploy confidently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are run THEN the system SHALL validate risk calculation logic with known test cases
2. WHEN the development environment is set up THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions and sample data
3. WHEN code changes are pushed THEN the CI pipeline SHALL run automated tests and report results
4. WHEN developers need to debug THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging and error messages
5. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL include health check endpoints for monitoring
