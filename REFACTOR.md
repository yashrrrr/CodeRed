**Benefits:** Reduced database load, faster API responses, cost optimization

### 3.2 Docker Containerization
**Current State:** Local development setup only
**Target State:** Containerized deployment with orchestration

**Tasks:**
- Create multi-stage Dockerfile for backend service
- Create separate Dockerfile for dashboard service
- Set up docker-compose.yml for local development
- Add production docker-compose with:
  - Redis service
  - PostgreSQL service (migration from SQLite)
  - Nginx reverse proxy
- Create Kubernetes manifests for cloud deployment
- Add health checks and resource limits

**Benefits:** Consistent deployments, easier scaling, environment isolation

### 3.3 OpenAI Integration Enhancements
**Current State:** Basic API calls with simple fallback
